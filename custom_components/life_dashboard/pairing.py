"""The pairing URL a QR code carries.

The QR is an ordinary https URL, because that is the one thing a phone camera knows
what to do with. Everything the phone needs is in the fragment, after the #, which
a browser never sends to any server (RFC 3986, section 3.5). On a phone with the app
installed, an Android App Link opens the app straight from the camera; without the
app, the page at PAIR_PAGE explains where to get it.

The format is shared with the app, which parses it, and with any receiver that wants
to be pairable the same way. Keep the two sides' test vectors identical.

This module imports nothing from Home Assistant.
