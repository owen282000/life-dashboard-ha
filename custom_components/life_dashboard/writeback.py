"""Receiving measurements on the phone: the Home Assistant half.

writeback_queue.py decides what a measurement is and what the phone is told; this
module is the thin layer around it that listens to the mapped entities, turns a state
into a reading in the units Health Connect wants, keeps the queue in .storage and
answers the phone's request. The options flow stores the mapping under
entry.options["writeback"]; a change there reloads the entry, which sets the
listeners again.

What a state event becomes:

- A state that is unknown, unavailable or not a number is skipped. So is the first
  state of an entity and a state Home Assistant restored at startup: a restored
  value's last_changed is the restart, not a measurement.
- The measured moment is the timestamp entity's value when one is mapped and it
  changed within the window around the event; otherwise last_changed (last_reported
  for an unchanged value that was reported again), marked time_source "state".
  Never last_updated. A timestamp entity that changes just after its value moves the
  reading it belongs to.
- Units are converted per event with Home Assistant's own converters, on the unit the
  state carries at that moment, without rounding. An entity with a unit outside the
  family (a weight in litres) is skipped and warned about once.
- Blood pressure is two entities; the two halves within ninety seconds of each other
  are one reading, timed on the systolic one.

        The window is at most what the queue keeps, and of the changes inside it the
        newest BACKFILL_MAX_PER_ENTITY count. Home Assistant's history only reverses
        a query's result in Python, so a limit in the query would take the oldest
        rows; the cap is applied here instead. The state the entity held when the
        window opened is asked for as well: it is not a reading (it is older than the
        window), but it says that the entity existed before, and for blood pressure
        it is the last known value of a half that did not change. Without it, the
        first change in the window is the entity's creation and is skipped, as the
        listeners skip an entity's first state.
