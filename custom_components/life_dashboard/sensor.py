"""Sensor platform for Life Dashboard.

Entities are created on the first value rather than all thirty up front, so a user
who syncs four data types sees four sensors. That is how the app's MQTT Discovery
behaves as well, and it keeps a phone's absent types out of the entity list.

Across a restart the entities come back before any payload does: they are rebuilt
from the entity registry and restore their own last value, which also reseeds the
ordering rule so a backfill arriving right after startup cannot overwrite newer
readings.

Screen time also gets one sensor per app, created disabled so the device page stays as
it was: the user enables the apps worth a sensor. Those are rebuilt from apps.py rather
than restored, because a disabled entity never holds a state to restore.
