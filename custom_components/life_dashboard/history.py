"""Turning payloads into history.

A sensor holds one value and Home Assistant stamps it with the moment it arrived, so a
year of backfill written to sensors lands entirely on today. Long-term statistics are the
other store: hourly rows an integration may write for any hour in the past. This module
decides what those rows should say.

It keeps a ledger rather than writing rows straight from a payload, for two reasons.
Statistics sums are cumulative, so changing a day in the past means rewriting every later
row, which needs the earlier amounts. And the same records arrive more than once, from
the app's outbox, from a re-run backfill, or after an edit in the source app, so every
contribution has to be replaceable rather than additive.

Nothing here imports from Home Assistant: the arithmetic is the part worth testing
exhaustively, and statistics.py is the thin layer that talks to the recorder.
