"""Signature verification and payload parsing for Life Dashboard.

This module deliberately imports nothing from Home Assistant, so the whole contract
with the phone can be unit tested on its own. The webhook handler feeds it a decoded
JSON object and gets back the sensor updates that object justifies.

The payload contract is documented in the companion app repository, docs/webhook.md
and docs/webhook-schema.json. The facts this module depends on:

- One sync is one POST per source; a backlog produces several POSTs, and a failed
  delivery is re-POSTed later from the app's outbox. So the same record arrives more
  than once and every update carries measured_at for the caller to order on.
- Records are optional everywhere. A payload only carries the arrays that had data.
- Nine dense series can arrive bucketed instead of raw, under the same key, with
  "bucket_start" as the reliable discriminator.
- The iOS app sends the same field names, daily_totals from 1.4.0 (none before), and
  its blood pressure records can lack "diastolic".

Since 0.7.0 the contract has a second half: the integration answers every accepted
POST with a JSON body, signed with a key derived from the same secret, so the phone can
receive measurements from Home Assistant. The request side of that (the "writeback"
block, the heartbeat) is read here; what goes into the answer is decided in
writeback_queue.py, and this module only signs and frames it.
