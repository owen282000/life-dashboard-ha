"""The queue of measurements waiting for a phone.

Home Assistant offers a reading; the phone writes it to Health Connect and confirms
it in its next request. Everything between those two moments is decided here: what
counts as one measurement, what counts as a correction, what the phone is told when
it refuses one, and how much is kept for a phone that does not come back.

The facts the design rests on:

- An id is "{entity_id}@{measured_at_ms}" and becomes Health Connect's clientRecordId.
  Inserting the same id again is an upsert there, and a higher version wins, so a
  re-delivery is harmless and a correction is the same id with version + 1. That is
  what lets this queue offer a reading again after every kind of loss (an outbox
  dropped on the phone, a crash while writing, a reinstall) without an exchange of
  uuids.
- A scale advertises the same reading for seconds, a polled integration writes an
  unchanged value every few minutes, and Home Assistant reports an unchanged state as
  an event of its own. The same value within ten minutes of the last time it was seen
  is therefore that measurement, not a new one; the window slides with every report,
  so a value that is polled all day stays one reading and a value that returns after
  a night's silence is a new one.
- The phone answers with ids and codes only, never with a value, and the codes form
  a closed set: some mean "do not offer this again", the rest "try again next time".
  An answer is about the version that was offered: a reading corrected between the
  offer and the answer stays in the queue with its higher version.

Nothing here imports from Home Assistant, so the whole of it is tested on its own;
writeback.py is the thin layer that listens to states and talks to the store.
