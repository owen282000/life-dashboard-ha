"""The Life Dashboard integration.

Receives webhook payloads from the Life Dashboard Companion apps, verifies the
signature, and dispatches the sensor updates a payload justifies.

The one rule worth knowing: an update is applied only when it is not older than the
value a sensor already holds. The app re-sends a batch after a failed delivery, from
its outbox at the next sync, and wholesale during a backfill, so the same record
arrives repeatedly with its original timestamps. Ordering on the moment a value
describes makes all of that harmless without keeping a record of uuids.
