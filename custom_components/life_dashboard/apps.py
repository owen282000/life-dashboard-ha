"""Which apps have a screen time sensor of their own, and what they last read.

A per-app sensor is created disabled, so most of them are never added to Home Assistant
and never restore a state of their own. What they need across a restart therefore lives
here instead, in one small store per entry: the label of every app that has a sensor,
so an entity rebuilt before the phone syncs keeps its name, and the newest day's table,
so a sensor the user has just enabled shows today's minutes as soon as the entry has
reloaded rather than at the next sync.

Two bounds keep the entity list from growing without end. An app needs a few minutes
over the days a payload carries before it gets a sensor, which leaves out what was only
opened once, and a phone gets a fixed number of app sensors at most. An app keeps its
sensor once it has one, also when it is no longer used: removing it would break the
automations and dashboards built on it.

A sensor the user deletes stays deleted. Its app is dismissed: the label goes, the slot
is free again, and the app gets no new sensor while the phone keeps sending it. The
store keeps a salted hash of a dismissed package rather than the package itself, since
all it has to answer is whether an app was dismissed, and the name of an app someone
chose to hide is exactly what should not stay behind in plain text. A hash of a package
name can still be checked against a guess, so this keeps the name out of sight, not
secret.
