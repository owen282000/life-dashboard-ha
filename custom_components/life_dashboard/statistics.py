"""Writing the ledger into Home Assistant's long-term statistics.

The thin layer between history.py, which decides what the rows say, and the recorder,
which stores them. One external statistic per data type per entry, fed from every
payload: a backfill fills the past, a normal sync extends the present.

External ids (`life_dashboard:<entry>_<key>`) rather than the sensors' own, because the
recorder compiles a sensor's statistics from its states itself, and two writers to one
running sum disagree at the seam. The sensors stay what they are, now; these are the
history.
